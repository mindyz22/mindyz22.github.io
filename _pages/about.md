Hi, I’m Mindy! I’m currently an undergraduate at MIT, double majoring in Computer Science & Cognitive Science, and Mathematics. I am interested in research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition.

I’ve had the chance to work on some exciting research, like integrating vision-language models into planning systems at the Learning and Intelligent Systems Lab under William Shen and Nishanth Kumar, and using probabilistic programming to model moral judgment at the Computational Cognitive Science Lab with Sydney Levine and Lio Wong. I also spent some time as a Machine Learning and Data Science intern at Nasdaq, where I worked on coding models to find patterns in options trading.

I also care deeply about mentorship and community. I was a Teaching Assistant for the MITES summer program, where I helped teach calculus to high school students, and I co-led community outreach for MIT’s First Generation and Low Income Student Committee.

In my free time, I’m passionate about art and design, playing musical instruments, ice skating and volleyball!
