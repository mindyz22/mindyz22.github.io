Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I’m Mindy! I’m currently an undergraduate at MIT, double majoring in Computer Science & Cognitive Science, and Mathematics. I am interested in research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition.

I’ve had the chance to work on some exciting research, like integrating vision-language models into planning systems at the Learning and Intelligent Systems Lab under William Shen and Nishanth Kumar, and using probabilistic programming to model moral judgment at the Computational Cognitive Science Lab with Sydney Levine and Lio Wong. I also spent some time as a Machine Learning and Data Science intern at Nasdaq, where I worked on coding models to find patterns in options trading.

I also care deeply about mentorship and community. I was a Teaching Assistant for the MITES summer program, where I helped teach calculus to high school students, and I co-led community outreach for MIT’s First Generation and Low Income Student Committee.

In my free time, I’m passionate about art and design, playing musical instruments, ice skating and volleyball!
